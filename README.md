Gesture Controlled Smart Light Switch  
A gesture-controlled smart light switch will be implemented on the Silicon Labs Blue Gecko Board. The Server gecko will be interfaced with an APD 9960 gesture sensor to detect gestures and a beefcake relay to switch a light on and off. The smart light switch will be able to detect four gestures swipe up, swipe down, swipe left and swipe right. A swipe up gesture will turn the relay switch ON and a swipe down gesture will turn the relay switch OFF. The state of the relay switch as well as the gesture detected will be displayed on the Server Gecko LCD Display.
