# Smart Light Switch  
A smart light switch will be implemented on the Silicon Labs Blue Gecko Board using Luminosity sensor. The Server gecko will be interfaced with a Luminosity sensor TSL2561 and a beefcake relay to switch a light on and off. The natural light will be checked by the luminosity sensor placed near a window. When there is sunlight present, it will turn off the lights and when it will be dark outside it will turn on the lights. It can be a very power efficient solution for home automation.
